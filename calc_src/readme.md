## Eitrix Calculator Source

To view and edit these source files, send them to your TI 83 Plus / 84 Plus
graphing calculator with [Axe Parser](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/456/45659.html) 
installed. These are the preferred source
files for Eitrix as the development process is more streamlined on that
platform. The app [zStart](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/429/42907.html)
is strongly recommended for assisted editing, as it
provides edit-from-archive, quit-without-saving, and jump-to-label features
that make the source easier to navigate, as well as compile- and run-
from-homescreen features that keep you from having to enter the Axe
or DoorsCS apps to reiterate on code changes.
